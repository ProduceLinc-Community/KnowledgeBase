Pallet Charge Assignments

The **Pallet Charge Assignment** functionality allows for the posting of actual purchase invoices and credit memo's from service providers through normal *Business Central*purchase documents, while also assigning the costs to appropriate pallet charges and pallet lots.

When the purchase document for pallet charges is posted, the cost amounts are assigned to the specified assignment target, for example a freight container code. The allocation of the cost amount to the individual pallet lots that relate to the assignment target is delayed until the first **Charge Calculation** of the relevant cost produce bill. This delayed spreading of costs to pallet lots reduces the occurrence of internal corrective postings.
