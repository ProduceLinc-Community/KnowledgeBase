Pallet Editor

The pallet editor can be used to manually edit field values of a pallet lot.




Built in business logic ensures that editable fields can only be edited under certain conditions - thus ensuring operational and financial integrity throughout the system. For more information, see[Pallet Editor Rules](/articles/Stock%20and%20Logistics/Pallet%20Editor/Pallet%20Editor%20Rules)(/articles/Stock%20and%20Logistics/Pallet%20Editor/Pallet%20Editor%20Rules.md)(/docs/articles/Stock%20and%20Logistics/Pallet%20Editor/Pallet%20Editor%20Rules.md)(docs/articles/Stock and Logistics/Pallet Editor/Pallet Editor Rules.md)(https://linc.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/8000098161)**.**




The system supports the tracking of changes to pallet lot fields with the use of Business Central's **Change Log** feature, and provides visibility on Pallet Selection, Pallet Allocation and Pallet Lines pages of the changes that were made.
