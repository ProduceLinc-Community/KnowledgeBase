Pallet File Processing

ProduceLinc's pallet file processing functionality allows for pallet files from producers, pack houses, cold stores, etc. to be imported for the purposes of creating palletised produce in the system (**P****allet Creation**), verifying and updating characteristics of existing pallets (**P****allet Verification**) and confirming and updating loaded pallets and related freight details (**C****ontainer Confirmation**).




It supports dynamic field mapping, which enables the user to import almost any text based, comma separated value or Excel based file and map the file fields to pallet and produce fields. It is also possible to translate any incoming field value to internal lookup values. Pallet file imports also have a preview mode with which the import mapping and translations can be previewed before committing the data.




The functionality also allows for setting up automatic pallet file imports and processing.




All pallet file imports are fully logged and detailed mapping and translation error logs are maintained, with user friendly features to resolve import errors and speed up file processing.




Pallet file processing for purposes of pallet creation results in palletised produce represented at various storage locations, which can then be tracked, transported and scheduled for sales allocation.




Pallet file imports are validated and confirmed at line level before palletised produce becomes available and visible to commercial users for sales allocation. The dynamic field mapping includes the ability to define which pallet fields should be compared and/or updated for purposes of pallet verification and container confirmation.
