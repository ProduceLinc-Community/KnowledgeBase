How to un-confirm pallets

* Once a pallet line is confirmed, it is possible to unconfirm it - should it be necessary to correct values on the pallet.
* This function is only allowed under the condition that no sales allocations, freight allocations and financial entries exist.
* The pallet will be deleted off the system as if it never existed.
* Once a pallet is set as Confirmed again, a new Pallet Lot No. will be allocated and pallet will be available as "stock".
