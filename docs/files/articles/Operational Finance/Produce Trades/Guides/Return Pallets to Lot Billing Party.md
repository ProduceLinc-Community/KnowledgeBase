Return Pallets to Lot Billing Party

Pallets can be returned to the Lot Billing Party directly from the produce trade. Such pallets will be flagged as Returned to Lot Billing Party and will no longer be available for allocation to delivery points and customers.

  


To Return pallets:

* Ensure that the pallet line(s) has been fully credited. Thus, the posted amount on the line must be zero.
* To process a return, select the pallet lot in Produce Trade Lines and choose Return to Lot Billing Party in the Produce Trade Lines menu.
