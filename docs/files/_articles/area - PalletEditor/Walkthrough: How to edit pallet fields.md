Walkthrough: How to edit pallet fields

Pallet lots can be edited directly from the **Pallet Line List** page.

* Select the pallet line (pallet lot) that you wish to edit; then choose **Manage** from the page menu, and select **Edit**.
* Enter a **Pallet Edit Reason**, then amend the necessary fields. Editing of the individual fields are subject to certain rules and conditions (see **Pallet Editor Rules**). An error citing one or more reasons will be generated if conditions exist that prevent a field from being modified.
* Close the page.
