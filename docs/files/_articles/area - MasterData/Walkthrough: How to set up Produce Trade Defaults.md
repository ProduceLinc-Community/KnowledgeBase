Walkthrough: How to set up Produce Trade Defaults

* Search for **Produce Trade Defaults**
* Choose **New** or select the first empty line in the page
* Select the relevant **Customer No** and **Salesperson Code.** These are mandatory fields.
* Select the **Commodity Group Code**. This is an optional filter field
* The default **Trade Type** can be selected should it be auto-populated to the *Trade Type*field on the Produce Trade header. This is an optional default. Should the user choose to not set up a default **Trade Type Code** here, a value will have to be entered manually on the produce trade header (for the customer) before posting the produce trade.
* Specific rules for the titles of the **Produce Trade's Proforma Invoice, Produce Trade Invoice**and **Produce****Trade****Credit Memo** can be defined in produce trade defaults. Select values if these titles should be the default values on the printed documents.
* If no matching rule for these titles is found in **Produce Trade Defaults**, the values as per Linc Setup will be used.
* It is possible to change these titles on the P**roduce Trade** itself, in which case the document(s) would then print the manually selected title.
