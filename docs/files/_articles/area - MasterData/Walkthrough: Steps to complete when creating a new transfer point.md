3. Point Mappings

* Search for Point Mappings
* Choose a Freight Point (from Linc Lookup Values)
* Select Location as the Mapping Type
* The Mapping Parent No. is not used for Location Freight Points
* Select a valid Location Code in Mapping Code (lookup to Location Table). Mapping Name will auto-populate.
