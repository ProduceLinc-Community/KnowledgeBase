Pallet Charges

ProduceLinc’s comprehensive Pallet Charge functionality can track, manage and post costs that are incurred throughout the supply chain.

This feature includes the ability to set up Pallet Charge Codes for different types of costs on a detailed and grouped level, define standard rates with dynamic filter options and assign and post actual cost invoices or credit memo’s.

The final costs can be reviewed on a pallet lot level on the cost produce bill in the context of the income and produce costs of the pallet lot.
