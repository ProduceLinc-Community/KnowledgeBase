# How to create a Transfer Produce Order

*   Use the “New Transfer Produce Order” button in the menu of the page to create a new order.
    
*   Enter the freight point (cold store / depot) to which you want to transfer pallets in the “Transfer Point Code” field in the General section.
    
*   Enter other values like the Loading Freight Points, expected load date, etc. – like you would on an outbound order.
    
*   If you plan to use Excel allocation for the produce order, you must also enter a _Freight Allocation Group_.
