Pallet File Translation

Pallet files are received from various sources, and the codes and values in these files do not always match with the codes and values as set up in your master data. **Pallet File Translations** support the setup of rules that will automatically translate values from pallet files to values that match your master data, and minimise errors that need to be resolved on imported pallet lines.
