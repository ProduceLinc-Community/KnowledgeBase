# How to set up Pallet Packing Setup

* Search for **Pallet Packing Setup**
* Choose **New** or select the first empty line in the page
* To set up a pallet quantity rule, values must be selected for **Commodity Group Code**, **Commodity Code**, **Outer Pack Code**, **Pallet Base Code**, **Pallet Height Code**and **Quantity per Pallet.**
* To set up Weight rule, rules must be set up for combinations of **Commodity Group Code**, **Commodity Code** and **Outer Pack Code**. The fields for **Size Code** and **Organisation Code** are optional filter fields, but if used in a weight rule you should ensure that values also exist in the same fields for all other rules with the same combination of **Commodity Group Code**, **Commodity Code** and **Outer Pack Code**. Also define the **Net Weight per Outer Pack**, **Gross Weight per Outer Pack** and **Standard Outer Pack Conversion** for every weight rule. Ensure that the fields for Pallet Base Code and Pallet Height Code are left empty for weight rules.
