Remove Pallets from Produce Trades

You may wish to remove pallets from a produce trade and put them back into stock so that they can be allocated for sales and freight again.




Typical scenario’s:

* The pallet never actually arrived at the customer. It was included in your load instruction, but was never loaded and received by the customer.




To Remove pallets:

* Ensure that the pallet line(s) has been fully credited. Thus, the posted amount on the line must be zero. All income charges for the pallet must also be fully credited.
* Posted Bill Amount must be zero
* Select the line and then choose 'remove pallets’ in the menu
* Note that this removes the pallet from the produce trade as well as from its freighter trip leg and container – as if it was never loaded.
